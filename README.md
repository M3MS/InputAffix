*Tested on: Chrome 43.0.2, Firefox 36.0.4, Internet Explorer 10.*

*Note: this plugin requires jQuery version 1.11 or above.*

Input Affix is a jQuery plugin that allows you to add prefixes and suffixes to your input fields such that when your users type, the suffix or prefix does not change or move, and the user selection is managed accordingly. For example, if you need to add a percentage or degree symbol to one of your fields, it can easily be done by:

```javascript
// For a suffix
// i.e. 100 becomes 100%
jQuery("#fieldThatNeedsPercentage").suffix("%");
jQuery("#fieldThatNeedsAngle").suffix("Â°");
```

You might cosider alternatively placing your prefix/suffix *outside* of the input field, but if you are serious about including it within the input field (i.e you want your users to be able to select the prefix and/or suffix when they interact with your input field), then use this plugin to easily add such.

## Usage
If you want to use the hosted libraries, just add the following to the head of your page:

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://static.jcoc611.com/hosted/js/InputAffix.0.1.2.min.js"></script>
```

Otherwise, you can host your own version of jQuery and Input Affix to suit your needs. After you have included both libraries, adding a prefix or suffix is easier than writing the HTML for them. Check the documentation out for the detailed explanation:

## Documentation

### .prefix(pre)
Adds the prefix *pre* to the input field given by the jQuery selector. The user will be able to select/copy the prefix, but won't be able to delete it or write over it. Any text input will be inserted after the prefix, such that the pre string is kept at the beginning of the input at all times.

Example:

```javascript
jQuery("#userField").prefix("Username: ");
```

### .suffix(suff)
Adds the suffix *suff* to the input field given by the jQuery selector. The user will be able to select/copy the suffix, but won't be able to delete it or write over it. Any text input will be inserted before the suffix, such that the suff string is kept at the end of the input at all times.

```javascript
jQuery("#percentageField").suffix("%");
```

*Note: calling both functions for an input field should also work.*

## Hosted library
